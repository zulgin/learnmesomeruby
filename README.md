===============

A journey towards Ruby proficiency. I intend to work through all the exercises in Zed Shaw's Learn Ruby the Hard Way and post my solutions into this repo. Feel free to compare your solutions to mine, improve upon mine (pull requests welcome), or simply inform me how badly they suck compared to some hypothetical optimal solution.
